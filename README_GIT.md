## Coding a new feature

1. First pull latest changes from `master` branch.

2. Start a new branch with a name of the new feature. For example, `time-log-button`.

3. Code your new feature.

4. Commit your code with a short, descriptive commit message. For example,
`Added time log button to dashboard view`. If your changes aren't yet finished but you want to
save it on GitHub, you can add "(WIP)" to your commit message to inform others that the commit
is work in progress. For example, `Added time log button to dashboard view (WIP)`.

5. Push changes to remote branch with same branch name. In our example the remote
branch would also be called `time-log-button`.

6. When the feature is finished, merge the master branch to your feature branch and fix any
merge conflicts. Commit and push your fixed branch to remote repo.

7. Finally got to <https://github.com/ilmaria/design_www> and click "New pull request".
Select your branch and make a pull request.
